# Installing

Source for drachtio server can be obtained from [github](https://github.com/davehorton/drachtio-server) (build instructions can also be found there).  The drachtio server has been tested on most Linux distributions, but the preferred deployment (because it has been the most heavily tested) is Debian 8 (Jesse).

For those who use [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) for automating builds, an [ansible role](https://github.com/davehorton/ansible-role-drachtio) is available.

Finally, a [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/drachtio/drachtio-server/) is also available via:
```js
docker pull drachtio/drachtio-server:latest
```

Please post any issues [here](https://github.com/davehorton/drachtio-server/issues) if you have problems building
